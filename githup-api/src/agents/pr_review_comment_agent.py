Your update to the regular expression in the `list_comments` function to handle both `\\r\\n` and `\\r` is well-considered and should effectively resolve the problem.\n\n### Code Summary\nThe modification to the regex pattern in `list_comments` is a straightforward and efficient solution. By splitting on `\\r?\\n|\\r`, you ensure that all line endings are correctly handled, which is crucial for maintaining the robustness of the formatting logic. The addition of test cases specifically targeting carriage return edge cases is an excellent approach to verify the fix and prevent regression.\n\n### Identified Risks\nWhile no specific risks were identified, it's always good practice to ensure that changes to regex patterns are thoroughly tested across various scenarios. The new test cases you've added do a great job of covering these edge cases.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. **Test Coverage:** Consider adding a few more test cases with mixed line endings in a single string to further ensure robustness.\n2. **Documentation:** It might be helpful to document this change in the code comments or in a developer's guide, explaining why this regex pattern was chosen, to assist future maintainers.\n\nOverall, this update is a valuable improvement to the codebase.
